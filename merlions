Merlions are bipedal aliens, generally between 150-180cm tall, weighing at 40-70kg, covered in brown or green furr with blue stripes across their back, they have big pointy ears and black eyes and a tail that reaches the ground.
Merlions have a special ability known as "redolex", where they fly into a serene rage that deepens their intellectual creativity, it allows them to connect ideas but blocks them from using it.
Though they do not typically wear clothes they do often wear powered exoskeleton with integrated tools or armor, often brandishing symbols on their exoskeleton which signifies their clan and rank, some apply vibrant dyes to their furr for the same reason.
Clans are made up of children, three parents and nine grandparents, when a child old enough to become a parent the grandparents are released from their clan and duties.
Merlions do not have male or female genders or sexes, instead they have three genders: linon, caion, vekon, to reproduce each contributes and all three can become pregnant. Depending on which gender the merlion is born from it will have slightly different morphology.
Linons tend to be bigger, protective and highly logical, merlions born from linons often have short tempers and use short bursts of redolex to help them think
Caions have longer, sharper claws and fangs, they have exceptional spacial awareness and senses, merlions born from caions often have purple stripes instead of blue ones.
Vekons are slightly smaller, have good social awareness and empathy, merlions born from vekons are natural leaders.
