Very little about Merlion technology is understood, not because they are secretive but because it is hard.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <h5>Hazards</h5>\r\n        <p>There are many hazards involved with FTL travel, a poorly designed ship or badly routed journey can easily spell death for the crew.<br/>\r\n        If the hyperspace bubble is formed prematurely then it becomes open to hyper excited cosmic radiation, this is the result of interaction between the rapidly collapsing space in front of the ship and cosmic radiation.<br/>\r\n        Any matter caught in the hyperspace bubble on the journey may drain the fuel, if this happens the ship might become stranded deep in interstellar space, as such it's extremely important that navigation is done carefully, even so there's always some risk that a journey may stop too early.<br/>\r\n        Since there can be no gravitation on board while in hyperspace crew may experience muscle mass loss and bone density loss<br/>\r\n        While in the bubble the ship is causally unlinked from the rest of the universe, it's impossible to communicate with such a ship, a crew may become lonely, depression is a high risk\r\n        </p>\r\n        <h5>Communication</h5>\r\n        <p>A ship with a hyperdrive is the fastest known object in the universe, all inter-star communication must happen via these ships, ships travelling between the stars often contain news from their origin, this is the only direct contact systems have with each other.<br/>\r\n        Transport ships are always empowered to represent their origin, they must make decisions on their own, communication back is not possible until they return.<br/>\r\n        Distant systems are often very isolated as a result</p>\r\n        </>;\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default FTLHyperDrive;","import React from \"react\";\r\nconst History: React.FC = () => {\r\n    return <>\r\n    \r\n    <p>\r\n        This section outlines the major events that shaped the world of Infinite Darkness\r\n    </p>\r\n    <HistorySection title='2039'>First permanent moon base, main purpose was to serve as a refueling station, this promised to open up most of the solar system</HistorySection>\r\n    <HistorySection title='2046'>First human sets foot on Mars with help of the moon base, after two years the small screw returns home.
