You may have a great idea for a story based around Andalusian left-handed barbed-wire weaving, but by definition, your players are less interested in it, and less knowledgeable about it, and won't get your clues or references. And they won't care.</li>\n            <li>Rules are for the players, not for world building.

You can threaten their friends, family, or homes, but by the end of the adventure, the players should not feel abused. Use their family as hostages, but expect them to be rescued, and to come home with more than they started with. If you burn down their cottage, they should wind up with a castle. The players should be glad that the backstory was used, not sorry that they had a background.</li>\n            <li>\n                A game is a co-operative venture. You don't have the right to force players into your game against their will, and for the same reasons, players don't have the right to force themselves into your game against your will.\n                <ol type='a'>\n                    <li>Not all games are alike, and that's fine. Not all players want the same things out of a game, and that's fine.</li>\n                    <li> Avoid having players who won't like the kind of game you're running.
