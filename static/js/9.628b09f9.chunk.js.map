Some of these also apply when planning or running a session.</p>\r\n        <ol>\r\n            <li>Don’t make it flammable if you don’t want it burnt.</li>\r\n            <li>The GM cannot make the PCs more complex than the players do. No matter what the character sheet says, there are usually only three PC characters – Snotty, Greedy, and Backstabbing.</li>\r\n            <li>What the players want today is a quick, easy victory. But what they will want tomorrow is to have brilliantly and bravely turned the tables to barely survive a deadly encounter where it looked like they were all about to die.</li>\r\n            <li>Never base a campaign on something you are more excited about than your players are. You may have a great idea for a story based around Andalusian left-handed barbed-wire weaving, but by definition, your players are less interested in it, and less knowledgeable about it, and won't get your clues or references. And they won't care.</li>\r\n            <li>Rules are for the players, not for world building. Theme, versimilitude and inspiration should be the driving forces when you construct a campaign.</li>\r\n        </ol>\r\n        <h2>Planning a session</h2>\r\n        <p>These generally concern what you want to/expect to happen the very next session.</p>\r\n        <ol>\r\n            <li>Don't put player characters into a deadly situation unless it is acceptable for the player characters to die.</li>\r\n            <li>\r\n                It's your job to build the problem. It's their job to find a solution. If you create a death trap with only one solution, then then they cannot get out unless they figure out what your solution is. But if you build death trap with no solutions, then any clever plan they come up with might work.\r\n            <ol type='a'>\r\n                    <li>The purpose of a death trap is not death; it is to make the players feel clever. Don't build one to cause death, and more importantly, don't build one to make them feel stupid.</li>\r\n                    <li>An escape proof trap, is, by definition, escape proof. What you want is a fool proof trap, and allow your players to amaze you with the quality of fools being made today.</li>\r\n                    <li>Do not confuse a death trap with no solutions with a death trap that cannot be solved.
