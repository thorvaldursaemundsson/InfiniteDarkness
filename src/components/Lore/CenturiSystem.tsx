    <h3>The Centauri System</h3>
    <p>The Centauri system is a trinary star system, the three stars Rigil Kenturus, Toliman and Proxima Centauri. Rigil and Toliman are in relatively close orbit, at their closest they are only 11 astronomical units apart, Proxima orbits at a distance of 13k AU (0.2 light years</p>
    <p>The Centauri Imperium controls most of the system, though Proxima is mostly independent</p>
    <h4>Rigil Kentaurus</h4>
    <p>Rigil is the biggest star and has 2 inner planets, it's theorized that if Rigil ever had more planets they would've been slingshotted out of the system from gravitational interaction with Toliman</p>
    <h5>Sheol</h5>
    <p>This small planet orbits Rigil at an extremely low and fast orbit, the planet is mostly covered in molten rock with islands of floating minerals, due to the extreme radiation and heat there is no industry, habitation or outposts</p>
