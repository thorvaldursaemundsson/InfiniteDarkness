    <h2>Fringe worlds</h2>
    <p>These systems are colonized by humans and are completely self sufficient, but they are also highly isolated and most people who live there have live harsh lives</p>
    <h3>Star System Ashra</h3>
    <h4>Ashra</h4>
    <p>Ashra is a yellow white main sequence star, 0.9 solar masses, age 6 billion years</p>
    <h4>Feshra</h4>
    <p>Innermost planet of Ashra, small planet composed mostly of magnetic iron. 0.1 earth masses, surface gravity 0.5g, it's believed that a stellar event has stripped this planet of its outer mantel leaving only the iron core. The extremely strong magnetic field protects the surface from radiation and allows a dense atmosphere of argon and carbondioxide to persist. 
        Average temperature ranges from 400 - 500 degrees celsius and orbits at a distance of 0.1 AU.
    </p>
    <h4>Noshra</h4>
    <p>A larger rocky planet with a dense atmosphere of carbondioxide and clouds of sulfides, several moons and large silicate rings. Average temperature ranges 90 - 180 celsius, surface gravity 2.1g and orbits at 0.4 AU</p>
    <h4>Neke</h4>
    <p>A water world rich in oceanic life, a small number of islands have all been settled by humans, as well as many seasteads that catch sea fauna. Surface gravity 0.9g, average temperature 0 - 50 celsius.
        Has two moons where most of the minerals are mined and refined since very little can be mined from the planet. Only half of the people in the Ashra system live on the planet.
        Orbits at 0.9 AU
    </p>
    <h4>Sylvis & Edis</h4>
    <p>Sylvis & Edis are binary gas giants orbiting Ashra at 4 AU and 0.2 from each other, between them they have over a hundred moons as well as a large asteroid belt orbiting them at 0.4 AU </p>
