        <h2>Klackons</h2>
        <p>Klackons are covered in a nail like armor that starts out rainbow refractory color and gets darker and matter over time, it hardens and eventually has to be shed, revealing underneath a new shiny colorful flexible armor</p>
        <p>Klackons have 4 eyes and 6 limbs, their legs tend to grow in proportion over time, they have two large upper arms equipped with pincers and two smaller lower arms equipped with a hand-like double pincer. The upper arms have strength and stability, the lower arms have fine motor control</p>
        <p>The Klackons' 4 eyes are located in a square pattern, the lower pair can see in blue and low ultra violet, the upper in green, red and high infra-red, as such the klackons can see 5 base colors, their infra-red allows them to see life forms even in absolute pitch black darkness</p>
        <p>As Klackons grow older they grow in size</p>
        <p>Klackons have no maximum age and grow bigger and smarter as they grow older</p>
        <p>They are hatched from eggs that are about 2dm large, when they are young they shed every 6-9 months, as they reach adolescence it slows down to once per year, when they are adult it's once every few years. Old klackons only shed around every 10th year</p>
        <p>The oldest klackons are several hundred years old and stand 4 meters tall, they can only move around using both their legs and upper arms due to their sheer mass</p>
