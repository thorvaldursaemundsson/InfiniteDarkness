        <h2>Credits</h2>
        <p>In the infinite dark void that is the future there is no cash, only digital credits.
            Digital credits (or just Credits) is a form of cryptographic and certified data contained within Credit Pads and banks
        </p>
        <h4>The Credit Pad</h4>
        <p>The Credit Pad (or sometimes credit box) is a digital tool that facilitates transfer of credits. Each pad contains a cryptographic 
            id which certifies that the credits are authentic.
            <br/>
            It works quite simply, a pad contains some amount of money and can send or receive to another pad through shortrange wireless transfer.
            <br/>
            The pad can be anonymous or individualized, password/fingerprint protected or open, and can contain a maximum of 1 million credits.
            <br/>
            An individualized pad with protection may be connected to a bank account which means it may contain unlimited amounts.
            A maximally protected pad can also have its contents retracted into the bank account, making it extremely difficult to steal money.
            <br/>
        </p>
        <h4>History of the Cryptocurrency</h4>
        <p>It was in the early 2100 that a kind of cryptocurrency had become the standard currency, since it was exceptionally hard to counterfeit but also allowed a central issuer to increase the amount.
            Each user could make a very strong authentication against any other user.
