        <h2>Credits</h2>
        <p>In the infinite dark void that is the future there is no cash, only digital credits.
            Digital credits (or just Credits) is a form of cryptographic and certified data contained within Credit Pads and banks
        </p>
        <h4>The Credit Pad</h4>
        <p>The Credit Pad (or sometimes credit box) is a digital tool that facilitates transfer of credits. Each pad contains a cryptographic
            id which certifies that the credits are authentic.
            <br />
            It works quite simply, a pad contains some amount of money and can send or receive to another pad through shortrange wireless transfer.
            <br />
            The pad can be anonymous or individualized, password/fingerprint protected or open, and can contain a maximum of 1 million credits.
            <br />
            An individualized pad with protection may be connected to a bank account which means it may contain unlimited amounts.
            A maximally protected pad can also have its contents retracted into the bank account, making it extremely difficult to steal money.
            <br />
            Any computer can also serve as a credit pad, and credit pads can be connected to a bank.
        </p>
        <h4>History of the Cryptocurrency</h4>
        <p>It was in the early 2100 that a kind of cryptocurrency had become the standard currency,
            one that was stable and could be used to buy goods and services easily and without hindrance
            since it was exceptionally hard to counterfeit but also allowed a central issuer to increase the amount.
            Each user could make a very strong authentication against any other user.
        </p>
        <h4>A rapid economy</h4>
        <p>When the solar system was first starting to be exploited the economy grew at an exponential pace, rare earth minerals like gold, irridium, platinum suddenly became common place.
            To combat exponential deflation Earth created the Solar Reserve Bank to issue more credits, inflation has kept below 0.5% and above -0.001% every since in the solar system.<br />
            However in other systems the credits become disintegrated from the economy of the solar system, as such rich people find themselves poor when they travel to another system, or poor becoming rich.
